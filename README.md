# Kyuukei Desktop Pet

Kemonomimi-chan by [ながユー](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2509595)

Inspired by the TL note from [Kyuukei](https://mangadex.org/group/7a85b9e9-8361-4653-8dd2-8783fe30023b/kyuukei).

Kyuukei/Kemonomimi-chan will randomly say stuff from Kyuukei TL notes.
Currently there are 21 text that will appear randomly. Maybe will add more.

## Controls

Ctrl + Shift + `=` and Ctrl + `-` to resize.
Alt + F4 to exit (Unfortunately I'm too lazy to implement one. Task manager also works)
## Downloads
